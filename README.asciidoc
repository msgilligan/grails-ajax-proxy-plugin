Grails Ajax Proxy Plugin
========================

Want to use some Ajax in your Grails application?  Same Origin Policy getting in your way?  Looking for a quick and easy solution?

For example, say you want to use the Google Translate API but either don't want to use JSONP or can't because you need to translate strings that are too long to include in the URL as query parameters.

Run

    grails install-plugin ajax-proxy
    
Add the folloing to grails-app/conf/Config.groovy

    plugins {
      proxy {
        proxyScheme = 'https://'
        proxyHost = 'www.googleapis.com'
        proxyPort = '443'
        proxyPath = ''
      }
    }
    
Write your JavaScript to access Google Translate at the following URL on your server

    /proxy/language/translate/v2
    
(That's `/proxy` + the path on the destination server)

You're done.

Notes
-----
Grails will process (e.g. turn a POST into a GET) and swallow the `X-HTTP-Method-Override header`.  (It appears this is done by the `HiddenHttpMethodFilter`.)

To pass your forwarded requests through unchanged use `X-Forward-HTTP-Method-Override`, which will be forwarded as `X-HTTP-Method-Override`.  (New in Version 0.1.2)
